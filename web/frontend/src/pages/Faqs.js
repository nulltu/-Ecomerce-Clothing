                Pyral has a constitutional obligation to collect sales use tax in those states we are licensed to do business.
                Sales tax is calculated using the address where the product is being shipped.
                If for any reason you believe you are exempt from paying sales tax,
                please contact us and we will assist you with processing your order.
                Please have all the proper exemption tax information available.
                Credit cards that do not participate in the verification process will not be accepted.

            <AccordionDetails>
              <Typography>
                Our shoes are sized according to the US standard; the size conversion from women's to men's shoes is 1.5 sizes down. <br />
              For example, if you were a size 8 in women's, you'd be a size 6.5 in men's.
              If you fall below men's 6.5, you would fit into the "Kids" category. <br />
              Please note, by design, our high performance skate shoes tend to fit snug, so you may want to select a half size larger. <br />
              Alternatively, if you have a wide foot, you may purchase one size larger to compensate for the width or check out designing your own pair of wide Customs!
